## Locks in SQL - A deep dive
<details>
  <summary>How Locks Work in PostgreSQL</summary>
  <br/>

  Locks in PostgreSQL are mechanisms used to control concurrency and prevent data inconsistencies. They ensure that multiple transactions can access and modify data without interfering with each other.

  In PostgreSQL, locks are acquired automatically by the database system whenever a transaction accesses or modified.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Locking Mechanisms</summary>
  <br/>

  **Explicit Locking:** Manually acquiring and releasing locks using commands like `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE`.

  **Implicit Locking:** PostgreSQL automatically acquires and releases locks based on operations or queries performed.

  _Example:_

  ```
  -- Acquire an exclusive lock on a row:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
  
  -- Acquire a shared lock on a row:
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1 FOR SHARE;
  ```

### Table lock
<details>
  <summary>Table level lock</summary>
  <br/>

  Table locks apply to entire tables and are used to prevent other transactions from accessing the table in conflicting ways.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Type of locks</summary>
  <br/>

  + AccessShareLock
  + RowShareLock
  + RowExclusiveLock
  + ShareUpdateExclusiveLock
  + ShareLock
  + ShareRowExclusiveLock
  + ExclusiveLock
  + AccessExclusiveLock
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Examples</summary>
  <br/>

  **AccessShareLock:**
  ```
  begin;
  lock table Email IN ACCESS SHARE MODE;
  select * from Email;
  ```
  _The lock is acquired on a specific table via the PostgreSQL SELECT command. After acquiring the lock on the table, we are only able to read data from it and not able to edit it._

  **AccessExclusiveLock:**
  ```
  begin;
  lock table Email IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
  ```
  _Only the person who applied the lock to the table can access it when utilizing it._
  
</details>

### Row locks
<details>
  <summary>Row level lock</summary>
  <br/>

  Row locks apply to individual rows within a table. They are used to prevent other transactions from modifying or deleting specific rows while they are being accessed.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Type of locks</summary>
  <br/>

  + FOR KEY SHARE
  + FOR SHARE
  + FOR NO KEY UPDATE
  + FOR UPDATE

  **Conflict Modes in Row Level Locks**:
  |                   | FOR KEY SHARE | FOR SHARE | FOR NO KEY UPDATE | FOR UPDATE |
  |-------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
  | FOR KEY SHARE     |               |           |                   |      X     |
  | FOR SHARE         |               |           |         X         |      X     |
  | FOR NO KEY UPDATE |               |     X     |         X         |      X     |
  | FOR UPDATE        |       X       |     X     |         X         |      X     |
  
</details>

### Page locks
<details>
  <summary>Page level lock</summary>
  <br/>

  Pagel locks are native to two types. **Share** & **Exclusive locks** limit read/write access to table pages. After a row is fetched or updated, these locks are immediately released.
